Course Launching Activities 
##############################

As the start date for your course approaches, you may want to accomplish certain tasks 

* Verify the course start date and time in Studio. See :ref:`Set Important
  Dates for Your Course`.
* Compose a welcome message and add it to the Course Info page. See :ref:`Add
  a Course Update`.
* Define and share an email address for the course staff and instructors to
  use for communicating operational issues.
* Prepare and send a welcome email message to currently enrolled students one
  week or more before the course start date. See :ref:`Send_Bulk_Email`.
.. * Open forum before course launch (optional)
* Prepare and send a launch email message to currently enrolled students on the course start date. 

*************************
Bulk Email 
*************************

With the bulk email feature, you can send email messages to course participants directly from the Instructor Dashboard. All team members who have the course staff or instructor role can use this feature to communicate with course participants before, during, and after the course run. 

When you send an email message from the Instructor Dashboard, you choose the message recipients by selecting one of these predefined groups:

* Myself, to test out a message before sending it to a larger group.
* Staff and instructors, to contact other members of the administrative team.
* All, to communicate with all currently enrolled students and the administrative team.

Before you use the bulk email feature, consider that messages cannot be cancelled after they are sent. Be sure to review each message draft carefully, and send each message to yourself for thorough review and testing, before you send it to all course participants.

--------------------------------
Message queueing and delivery
--------------------------------

When you send a message, it is queued for processing. Multiple courses use the same email queue, so it can take some time for your message to be delivered to its recipients. If your course is a MOOC, consider limiting the number of messages that you send to all course participants to no more than one per week. 

Email tasks run in the background, so you can
